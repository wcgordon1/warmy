Let me be direct.

If you are reaching out to startups without knowing **when they just raised**, you are playing a losing game.

Not because your product is bad. Not because your messaging sucks.  
Because you’re late.

I’ve watched this for years. Same pattern. Teams build big lists, send thousands of emails, tweak copy, blame subject lines. Meanwhile, the reps who consistently close deals are doing something simpler.

They are just earlier.

That’s it.

And the easiest way to be early is to focus on **startups that just raised funding**.

---

## Why timing matters more than anything else

When a startup raises money, a few things happen immediately:

- budgets open up  
- hiring ramps up  
- vendors get evaluated  
- internal systems get replaced  
- leadership is thinking about growth  

This is not a theory. This is how companies operate.

And this window is short.

- First **7 days**: very few vendors have reached out yet  
- Days **7–14**: competitive but still strong  
- Days **14–30**: crowded  
- After 30 days: decisions are already in motion or done  

If you are not reaching out inside that window, you are competing with people who already got there first.

That’s why using something like [JustRaisedFunding](https://justraisedfunding.com/) gives you a real advantage. It is built around **fresh funding signals**, not static lists.

## The difference between “leads” and “timing”

Most people think they need more leads.

They don’t.

They need better timing.

Here’s what happens with traditional lead databases:

- you pull 1,000 contacts  
- half of them are outdated  
- none of them have a real trigger  
- you send anyway  

Now compare that to a funding-triggered list from [JustRaisedFunding](https://justraisedfunding.com/):

- companies just raised  
- they are actively making decisions  
- your outreach has a reason to exist  

That single difference changes your entire funnel.

## Real numbers: what this does to your pipeline

Let’s not overcomplicate it.

### Without timing (standard outbound)

- 1,000 contacts  
- 4% reply rate → 40 replies  
- 30% positive → 12  
- 40% meetings → 5  
- 20% close → 1 deal  

### With funding timing

- 1,000 contacts  
- 7–9% reply rate → 70 to 90 replies  
- 45% positive → 30 to 40  
- 45% meetings → 13 to 18  
- 25% close → 3 to 5 deals  

Same effort.

2x to 4x outcomes.

This is why [JustRaisedFunding](https://justraisedfunding.com/) is not just another tool. It directly impacts revenue.

## Where to find startups that just raised

There are really only three ways to do this.

### 1) Funding alert tools (best option)

This is the only approach built for sales.

With [JustRaisedFunding real-time alerts](https://justraisedfunding.com/), you get:
- newly funded companies  
- verified contacts  
- context around growth  

You are not researching. You are acting.

---

### 2) Funding databases (research tools)

Examples include platforms like Crunchbase or PitchBook.

They are good for:
- investor research  
- funding history  
- market analysis  

They are not good for:
- fast outreach  
- clean contact data  
- immediate execution  

You end up doing a lot of manual work.

---

### 3) General lead databases

Tools like Apollo, ZoomInfo, Lusha.

They are useful, but:

- funding is not the core signal  
- data freshness varies  
- you are often late  

They give you contacts, not timing.

---

## Time saved (this adds up fast)

Let’s talk about something most people ignore.

Time.

Typical outbound workflow:
- 2–3 hours building a list  
- 1–2 hours cleaning  
- 1 hour verifying  

That’s **4 to 6 hours per campaign**.

With [JustRaisedFunding](https://justraisedfunding.com/):

- list is already filtered  
- contacts are usable  
- you can export and send immediately  

You can launch in **under 30 minutes**.

Over a month:
- 15 to 25 hours saved  
- more campaigns  
- more follow-ups  
- more revenue  

---

## Simple playbook (this actually works)

Don’t overthink this.

### Step 1: Use a tight window
- last 7 to 14 days  

### Step 2: Pick one niche
- one industry  
- one role  
- one problem  

### Step 3: Pull leads fast
Use [JustRaisedFunding startup leads](https://justraisedfunding.com/) and move quickly.

### Step 4: Write a real reason to reach out
Bad:
> “Wanted to connect”

Good:
> “Saw you just raised, usually teams at your stage are solving X right now”

### Step 5: Keep it simple
- 1 email  
- 1 follow-up  
- optional LinkedIn  

That’s enough.

## Example outreach

### Email

Subject: Congrats on the raise

Hey {{FirstName}}, saw you just raised. Congrats.

Most teams at your stage are making decisions around {{problem}} in the first few weeks. We help with that without adding complexity.

If helpful, I can send a couple examples and pricing.

If not you, who owns this?

---

### LinkedIn

Saw the raise, congrats.  
If you’re evaluating vendors right now, I can send something quick. Worth it?

---

### Call opener

Congrats on the funding. I’ll be quick.  
Companies at your stage usually make a decision on {{category}} early.  
Are you the right person?

---

## The bottom line

You don’t need more leads.

You need to be earlier.

That’s it.

And the easiest way to do that is to focus on startups that just raised funding using a tool like [JustRaisedFunding](https://justraisedfunding.com/).

Because in startup sales, the difference between early and late is everything.
