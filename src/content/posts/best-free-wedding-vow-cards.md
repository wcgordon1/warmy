## What makes vow cards “the best”

The best vow cards do three jobs:

1. **They are readable under stress**  
2. **They prevent line skipping**  
3. **They survive real ceremony conditions**  

The best cards are not the prettiest. They are the easiest to deliver from.

### Beginner-friendly explanation

Vow cards are small printed cards you hold during the ceremony so you do not rely on a phone.

### Technical depth

A strong vow card layout includes:
- line breaks placed at breath points
- font size that survives shaky hands and dim light
- spacing that prevents accidentally reading the same line twice
- margins that keep fingers off the text
- page breaks that do not cut mid-sentence or mid-promise

## Ranking criteria

Use this list to evaluate any vow card method, even if you do it manually.

### 1) Readability
- 16 pt is the minimum
- 18 to 22 pt is safer for most people
- 22+ pt is smart for outdoor weddings and emotional speakers

### 2) Line spacing
- 1.3 to 1.6 spacing is the sweet spot
- promises should be separated, not buried

### 3) Page break logic
Never break:
- mid-sentence
- mid-promise
- mid-emotional beat

### 4) Edit loop speed
If you change one line, can you update the formatting quickly?

### 5) Preview and export
Can you preview what will print before you waste paper?

### 6) Workflow integration
Does it connect cleanly to:
- drafting
- templates
- practice

## Formatting rules you can follow

These rules come from watching what fails in real ceremonies.

### Font size
- indoor: 18 to 20 pt
- outdoor: 20 to 24 pt
- emotional speakers: go bigger than feels necessary

Hot take: printing bigger is never the mistake. Printing small is.

### Line length
Shorter lines are easier to scan. If you are using a narrow card size, do not fight it. Embrace shorter lines and more breaks.

### Paragraph blocks
Keep blocks short:
- 2 to 4 lines per block
- blank line between emotional beats

### Promise formatting
Write promises as separate lines:
- “I promise ______.”
- “I promise ______.”
- “I promise ______.”

If promises are inside a paragraph, they disappear when you are nervous.

### Visual anchors
If you need a small navigation trick:
- bold the first 2 to 4 words of each promise only
- do not bold whole paragraphs

### Two-card split rule
If your vows exceed one card, split into two at a natural pause:
- Card 1: opening + memory
- Card 2: promises + close

Find the pause point by rehearsing:

## Printing specs and materials

### Paper stock
- indoor: medium cardstock is fine
- outdoor: thicker stock helps with wind and grip

### Finish
- matte is safest for glare
- avoid glossy if you expect bright light or outdoor sun

### Quantity
Print:
- 2 copies for you
- 2 copies for your partner

Put one backup set in the “stuff that saves the day” pile.

## Conversion logic and example conversions

Vow cards are a conversion step. You are converting writing into delivery.

### Conversion 1: dense paragraphs -> breath blocks

**Before**
Four long paragraphs.

**After**
- split into small blocks
- add blank lines between beats
- promises become separate lines

Why it works:
Your eyes do not get lost in a wall of text.

### Conversion 2: 2.5 minute vow -> two-card layout

**Before**
Long vow that runs off the card.

**After**
- split at a natural beat
- keep promises together
- keep the closing line alone

Process:
1. rehearse and mark pause points:
   [Practice Wedding Vows](https://www.vows.you/practice-wedding-vows)
2. format for print:
   [Free Wedding Vow Cards](https://www.vows.you/wedding-vow-cards)

### Conversion 3: outdoor version vs indoor version

Create two versions:
- outdoor: shorter, larger font, more spacing
- indoor: standard length, still readable

Print both and choose based on conditions.

## Real examples with analysis

### Example 1: Chicago indoor ceremony, low lighting

**Persona**
Jamie, nervous, worried about small text.

**Formatting choices**
- 20 pt font
- extra spacing between promises
- larger margins for grip

**Why it works**
Low lighting and nerves reduce visual precision. Bigger text and spacing reduce errors.

Draft and structure:
- [Wedding Vow Generator](https://www.vows.you/)
- [Free Wedding Vow Templates](https://www.vows.you/wedding-vows-template)

### Example 2: bright outdoor ceremony, sun glare

**Formatting choices**
- matte stock
- 22 to 24 pt font
- two-card split if needed

**Why it works**
Sun glare and wind are real problems. Solve them physically.

## Glossary

### Breath point
A natural pause spot. Vow cards should reflect these pauses with line breaks.

### Margin
White space around text. It improves grip and readability.

### Page break
Where one card ends and the next begins. It should never cut mid-promise.

### Promise segmentation
Promises written as separate lines so they are easy to deliver.

### What paper should I use?
Medium to thick cardstock. Matte finish if outdoors.
