      <p>
        Warm Websites is a small studio for building fast, clear websites that feel
        good to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        We focus on the basics: structure, speed, copy, and the details that make a
        site quietly trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space is where we share what we notice, what we test, and a few of the
        best websites we’ve come across on the internet.
