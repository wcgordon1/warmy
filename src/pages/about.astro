      <p>
        UINUX Blog is a quiet place for writing about systems, design decisions,
        and the craft of building digital products with restraint.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is part of <a href="https://uinux.co">UINUX</a>, a design practice
        focused on systems over themes, clarity over complexity, and long-term
        thinking over trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog exists to share ideas, not to sell. There are no newsletters,
        no pop-ups, no tracking. Just writing.
